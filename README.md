# SuperSimpleStocks
Super Simple Stocks test python repository

This repository contains the Stock class & StockMain module.  The module is a python substitution for a singleton class.

The StockMain Module contains the functions that are specified in requirements (not published here due to copyright on documentation)
There is an internal test class which exercises these functions although in a more realistic scenario a further input source would be added.  Sufficient testing has been carried out to prove the basic functionality (available in as a method in the StockMain module) however this is not exhaustive. 

This code has been written to be run on a Linux platform with python 2.7 installed.
The files should (including __init__.py) should be copied into a directory and given execute permission.
The main module can be run by typing 'python StockMain.py'
